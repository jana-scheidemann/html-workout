        <h2 id="facts">fun and very fun facts about sloths</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This is not a surprise, but now you know for a fact, that sloths are
            the slowest mammal in the world.
          </li>
          <li>
            They prefer to be in trees, it is like their home. The safest place
            for them is high above the ground where they can protect themselves
            from predators.
          </li>
          <li>They come down usually only for pooping - so once a week.</li>
          <li>
            They are faster in the water than they are on land. Sloths can swim
            three times as fast in the water as they can on land.
          </li>
          <li>Sloths are around three times stronger than humans.</li>
          <li>
            They can turn green. Sloths can grow a layer of algae as a
            camouflage method to help protect them from predators.
          </li>
          <li>Sloths are color-blind.</li>
          <li>
            Sloth mums give birth in trees. The mother will give birth up in the
            trees and scoop her baby up after birth and lay it across her
            stomach.
          </li>
          <li>Sometimes sloths give birth upside down.</li>
          <li>
            Sloths can fall 100 feet without injury. Sloths are designed to fall
            out of trees and they fall out of them on average once a week.
          </li>
          <li>
            They can hang upside down. This is partly due to their intense
            amounts of upper body strength, but they also breathe better this
            way.
          </li>
          <li>
            A sloth can turn their head 270 degrees. This is because they have
            two extra vertebrae in their neck.
          </li>
          <li>
            They love sleeping. Sloths sleep on average 15-20 hours within a
            day.
          </li>
        </ul>
